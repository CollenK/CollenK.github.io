                CareerFoundry is a 6-month intensive training program for web developers,
                specializing in Ruby on Rails and front-end development. I graduated from the
                program in September 2016.

                With over a 400 hours in coding, I built a fluency in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript,
                jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. I built two projects from scratch, using MVC, RESTful,
                and object-oriented design patterns. I learned the value of version control while
                using Git and GitHub, and implemented unit, functional, and feature tests using
                RSpec, FactoryGirl, and Capybara

                <strong>The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                This course contains nearly 30 hours of video lectures. Starting with the basics of Ruby,
                I learned how to hand-code a Rails app -- including a complete authentication system without
                the use of Devise.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built 4 separate web apps using a range of technologies, including Git for version control,
                GitHub as a code repository, Heroku for production deployment, AWS S3 cloud storage, Sendgrid
                for production email, Devise for user authentication, Multi-Tenancy using Milia, Stripe API
                for payment processing (creating custom credit card forms), Ajax, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap,
                and wireframing tools for concept creation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also learned how to build test suits by writing Unit, Functional, and Integration tests.
